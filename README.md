This repository is a migration of the legacy one hosted on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/linknx/) which is now deprecated.

## Documentation
Read the [wiki pages](https://github.com/linknx/linknx/wiki) for detailed information about how to build, install, configure and run linknx.

## How to build linknx
The best option is to download a tarball corresponding to a specific version (see links below). Then, run
```
./configure
make install
```
If the build finishes with errors, review them carefully. The most common cause is a dependency that is not installed on your system.

If you need to build the latest revision from the *master* branch (which is neither required nor recommended for standard usage), do not forget to update the GNU build system first.
```
autoreconf --install
```
should suffice. Then, run configure and make install as for other versions.
